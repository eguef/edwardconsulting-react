              How we reinvented charity transparency by running a Design Sprint
              across four time zones. (Note: The following article presupposes
              that you know the Design Sprint process. If you donâ€™t, please look
              them up first.)

              Recently, we got approached by Daniel from SaveTheChildren to work
              together with the CEO of BitGive Connie on the transformation of
              their charity platform onto a blockchain. The idea was to increase
              transparency and overall trust for charity projects.

              The problem was that Daniel lives in New Zealand and Connie in the
              US, while I was in Berlin, Germany.

            Obviously, with my Design Sprint skills I suggested to run a Remote
            Sprint.
